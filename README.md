Stack trainer
=============

Front page switches between two states, neutral and timing.
Neutral state has links to setup & stats, and a big 'Go' button.

Go button takes you to timing state. You see a big number, or a card, and the Go button now is an ok button.
Links at the bottom have temporarily disappeared

Pressing the ok button takes you back to the neutral state. Now you see the number and its corresponding card.
Go button now has become two buttons, Correct and miss. Pressing correct/miss makes go button appear again.

Pressing correct adds the time and increments the tries counter for the 'correct' stat tracker for that card. Pressing miss just increments the counter.

The card-number link is two-way, and they are considered separate links stats-wise.

Setup gives you the opportunity to edit the stack list, as well as if numbers, card, or both should be available for guesswork. Also possibly, random, shuffled, ordered. Also possibly choose statistical prob. for numbers shown, and range.

Stats shows you the mean time, and the variance or something, for you guesses for every link. As well as a counter for how many measurements you have for each link.
